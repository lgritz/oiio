Get last day's pix dirs:
    bash get-todays-shots.bash


Filter to catch the image dirs we care about:

cat stsearch.*.*.txt | grep /shots | grep -v aov_ | grep -v util_ | grep -v headers | grep -v script | grep -v /vcr | grep -v _ncf_ | grep -v _nch_ | grep -v checkpoint | grep -v _txtif |tee imagedirs.txt


Extract one representative image file from each directory:

sample-each-image-dir.bash imagedirs.txt > workimages.txt


At home, generate list of all the image files:

find ~/Pictures -name "*jpg" -print > homeimages.txt
